# Golem Full-text Search Engine

Golem Network is a cloud computing power service where everyone can develop, manage and execute workloads in an unstoppable, inexpensive and censorship-free environment.

Since Beta.2 Golem supports a new model of computation â€“ services. In contrast with batch tasks, services are expected to be long-running processes that don't have any natural completion point but rather are started and stopped on explicit command. The goal of this project is to build a full-text search service on Golem. The service allows its users to perform search queries over a corpus of documents submitted by the requestor during deployment.

## Examples

Some sample text files are located in `service/data/`

Entering the search term `golem` will return the following result:

```
[
   {
      "filename":"testfile3.txt",
      "lines":[
         {
            "line":1,
            "positions":[
               17,
               73
            ]
         }
      ]
   },
   {
      "filename":"testfile2.txt",
      "lines":[
         {
            "line":1,
            "positions":[
               13
            ]
         },
         {
            "line":0,
            "positions":[

         }
      ]
   }

```

Entering the search term `network` will return the following result:

```
[
   {
      "filename":"testfile2.txt",
      "lines":[
         {
            "line":0,
            "positions":[
               6
